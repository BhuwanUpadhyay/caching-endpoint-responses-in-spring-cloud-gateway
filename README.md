# Caching and Load balancing in Spring Cloud Gateway

Blog: <https://bhuwanupadhyay/blog/blog-code-example-template/>

## Walkthrough

In microservice architecture the services are run in several different places at the same time means that any network delays will affect response time.
Also, othes factors like round trip time, a protocolâ€™s handshake latency, time-to-first-byte and time-to-meaningful-response may cause the high latency. To avoid this situation we can cache endpoint's responses in API Gateway. With caching, you can reduce the number of calls made to your endpoint and also improve the latency of requests to your API.

**Code** I like build the stuff by writing maintainable code.
